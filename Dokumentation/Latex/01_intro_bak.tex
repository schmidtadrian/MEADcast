\section{Motivation} % (fold)
\label{sec:Motivation}
\begin{itemize}\itemsep0em
    \item Economic Volume
    \begin{itemize}\itemsep0em
        \item Plenty regions with limited bandwidth
        \item Tackles ongoing increasing demand
        \item Reduce CO2 emissions
        \item Reduce Costs
    \end{itemize}
    \item Use cases
    \begin{itemize}\itemsep0em
        \item Video/Audio Conferences
        \item Multimedia streams (especially apps)
        \item Collaborative applications
        \item VoIP \& IPTV
        \item Multiplayer games
        \item Huge file transfers?
        \item Distributed simulation
    \end{itemize}
    \item Existing approaches
    \begin{itemize}\itemsep0em
        \item Existing approaches simplify multicast routing or increase the overall availability
        \item But non of them tackles the following problem: client-side management effort, fallback, privacy
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Challenges} % (fold)
\label{sec:Challenges}
\begin{itemize}\itemsep0em
    \item High technical complexity
    \begin{itemize}\itemsep0em
        \item Requires interaction of various protocol on multiple layers
        \item Inefficient Class-D routing
    \end{itemize}
    \item Security
    \begin{itemize}\itemsep0em
        \item Higher complexity to implement reliability, encryption, authorization and authentication
        \item Increased risk of amplification attacks
    \end{itemize}
    \item Availability
    \begin{itemize}\itemsep0em
        \item Limited address space (especially IPv4)
        \item All nodes along a packets path must support multicast
        \item All involved network operator must support Intra-Domain multicast
    \end{itemize}
    \item Limited urge for change
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Most traffic is TCP/HTTP, which is harder to implement over multicast
        \item Browsers can't handle UDP (besides QUIC)
        \item Just throw higher bandwidth and transfer speed at it to serve increasing requirements
        \item No direct effect on user
        \item ISPs are not interested in multicast
        \item Limited use cases
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Goal/Contribution} % (fold)
\label{sec:Goal/Contribution}
\begin{itemize}\itemsep0em
    \item Goal
    \begin{itemize}\itemsep0em
        \item Overcome technical and availability obstacles while preserving privacy
        \item This means: agnostic clients, unicast fallback
    \end{itemize}
    \item Contribution
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Kernel implementation of MEADcast for routers and senders
        \item System library provides sender API
        \item Evaluate ease of MEADcast adoption and performance comparison to unicast (may also IP multicast)
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
