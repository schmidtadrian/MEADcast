% first fully functional (send, discovery, fallback, ...) implementation of sender and router
% comparison to uni and multicast based on various metrics
% test dynamic situations (firewall & fallback, link failure, route change)
% propose improvements
% tested own improvement (no hop by hop)
% strategic deployment at key locations can result in significant netload and upstream savings
% so far no disadvantage in using MEADcast as the sender, because of robust fallback mechanism
