% what is multicast
% why it makes sense in theory
% still lacks far behind expectations
% several reasons...
Over the last two decades, the number of people with access to the internet has
    continuously increased at a rate of 5\%, resulting in a current total of
    over 5 billion individual internet users \cite{itu_digdev}.
Furthermore, the unrelenting demand for data has led to an average growth in
    total bandwidth usage of 30\% over the past five years.
This development was further accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic, as the
    increased reliance on remote work, online education, and digital
    entertainment surged the bandwidth consumption \cite{cartesian_us_bw}.
These growth rates are expected to remain high in the future.
Especially Multimedia content like Video Streams, Conferences, and Online Games
    depict a major portion of the global internet traffic.
Video traffic is accountable for more than half of the bandwidth consumed in
    2020 \cite{cartesian_us_bw}.
Network Operators and Service Providers need to comply with the continuously
    rising demand.

Already in the late 1980s, \citeauthor{deering1990multicast} proposed a
    multicast extension to the IP protocol, to facilitate efficient multipoint
    communication (\textit{1:m, m:n})
    \cite{deering1990multicast, rfc1112_ipmc}.
Multicast offers the advantage, to greatly reduce the occupied bandwidth by
    condensing identical traffic into a single stream, targeted towards
    multiple recipients \cite{rfc3376_igmp}.
Routers may replicate packets of that stream at points where the paths towards 
    the receivers diverge.
Many of today's internet services, particularly those with high bandwidth
    demands, may benefit significantly from multicast delivery
    \cite{ratnasamy2006revisiting, meadcast1}.
Besides technical benefits, the adoption of multicast communication could
    reduce the emissions caused by \gls{ct}.
Several studies assert that networks are accountable for a major portion of
    today's \gls{ct} emissions \cite{andrae2015global}.
Furthermore, they forecast strongly increasing energy consumption by networks
    until 2030.
Multicast communication has the potential to lower energy consumption and
    therefore emissions by promoting more efficient use of network resources
    and potentially reducing the need for additional infrastructure.

\section{Challenges of Multicast} % (fold)
\label{sec:Challenges of Multicast}
% Security
%   - Higher comlexity to implement known features like reliability,
%     encryption, authorization, authentication
%   - Increased risk of amplification attacks


% usage on local scope (examples!)
The application of IP-Multicast has yielded mixed results.
Practically all of today's devices support IP-Multicast
    \cite{ratnasamy2006revisiting}.
Furthermore, it is utilized on a local scale, and various protocols like IPv6
    Neighbor Discovery \cite{rfc4861_ipv6_nd}, RIPv2 \cite{rfc2453_rip}, OSPF
    \cite{rfc2328_ospf} and mDNS \cite{rfc6762_mdns} rely on multicast.

However, more than thirty years since the initial proposal of IP-Multicast, its
    global deployment and usage still lags far behind expectations
    \cite{diot2000deployment, ratnasamy2006revisiting}.
Despite the potential advantages of Multicast, the majority of internet traffic
    continues to rely on point-to-point communication, known as
    \textit{unicast}.
There are several reasons for the limited usage of IP-Multicast.

\paragraph{Feasibility} % (fold)
\label{par:Feasibility}
Besides the aforementioned advantages, IP-Multicast entails various technical
    obstacles.
In comparison to unicast, it suffers from an increased technical complexity,
    requiring the interaction of various protocols on multiple network layers
    \cite{ratnasamy2006revisiting,diot2000deployment}.
Furthermore, multipoint communication in general interferes with the
    application of today's widespread security mechanisms like encryption
    \cite{rafaeli2003group_key_mgm}.
IP-Multicast is based on a fixed class D address space \cite{rfc1112_ipmc},
    which bears an insufficient number of addresses \cite{meadcast2} and a
    complex routing procedure
    \cite{diot2000deployment,ratnasamy2006revisiting}.
Global IP-Multicast availability is limited because successful packet delivery
    necessitates all routers along the path to support multicast.
However, this scenario is unlikely since many commercial routers come
    preconfigured with IP-Multicast disabled \cite{aruba_doc}.
Moreover, the following paragraph describes, why Network Operators are probably
    not willing to enable it.
% All involved network operators are required to support Intra-Domain,
% paragraph Feasibility (end)

\paragraph{Desirability} % (fold)
\label{par:Desirability}
% General:
%   - by default no built in security & harder to implement todays security
%     standards on top
%   - No explicit effect on end user --> they will not push ISPs
%   - Most traffic is TCP/HTTP which is hard to implement over multicast
%   - Browsers can't handle UDP
%   - Limited use cases

% Network Operators are not interested:
%   - amplification attacks
%   - billing harder
%   - technical complexity not worth effort, unicast is "good enough" (there is a source)

% IP-Multicast, formally known as \gls{igmp}, offers very limited security
%     features.
So far, Network Operators and ISPs have shown limited efforts to deploy
    Multicast within their Administrative Domains
    \cite{diot2000deployment, ratnasamy2006revisiting}.
The increased technical complexity of Multicast requires more extensive
    management efforts.
Additionally, due to the complex routing procedure, infrastructure upgrades may
    be necessary.
Despite its potential for significant bandwidth savings, ISPs seem to assess
    the deployment of IP-Multicast as an unsuitable investment
    \cite{ratnasamy2006revisiting}.
Another reason is the more complex pricing model of multipoint communication.
Charging for multicast services is non-trivial compared to existing unicast
    billing \cite{ratnasamy2006revisiting}.
On top of that, IP-Multicast hampers Network Operators' ability to anticipate
    network load.
Forecasting the number of replicas generated from a multicast packet, entering
    the Network Operators Administrative Domain, is unfeasible
    \cite{diot2000deployment}.
Combined with the limited security mechanisms of IP-Multicast, this represents
    a vulnerability, potentially exploited for amplification attacks.
This fact makes intra-domain IP-Multicast even more unlikely.

Unless ISPs face pressure to expand their service offering, increasing
    multicast deployment is doubtful.
As multicast delivery has no direct impact on receivers, customers are not 
    expected to exert the necessary pressure.
Moreover, statistics illustrate that more than half of the internet traffic
    volume is HTTP-based \cite{cloudflare2023radar}, which is not well suited
    for multipoint communication.
Additionally the usage of Multicast is discouraged by web browsers, the most 
    widely utilized HTTP clients, due to their technical limitation to
    TCP/HTTP.

% Identify scenarios & application categories/characteristics justifying the usage of MEADcast

The current state of the internet put forth various unicast-based alternatives,
    aimed at addressing the absence of a globally usable multicast protocol.
One such alternative, known as MEADcast, offers the capability for 1:n
    sender-based IPv6 multipoint communication over the internet
    \cite{meadcast1, meadcast2}.
Key features of MEADcast include the preservation of receiver privacy,
    technology-agnostic destinations, and zero network support requirements.

As proposed by \citeauthor{meadcast2}, the primary goal of this thesis is to
    conduct a real-world evaluation of MEADcast, utilizing a Linux Kernel
    implementation of the required router software \cite{meadcast2}.
This step represents a logical progression following previous investigations of
    MEADcast, which were based on network simulations \cite{meadcast1} and
    \gls{sdn} \cite{sdn_ba}.
% This step represents the next logical step following a simulation- \cite{meadcast1}
%     and SDN-based \cite{sdn_ba} investigation of MEADcast.
The evaluation will focus on the following aspects:

\paragraph{Feasibility Study} % (fold)
\label{par:Feasibility Study}
The first part of the evaluation will assess the feasibility of deploying
    MEADcast in a real network.
This aims to identify potential limitations and structural issues of the
    current protocol specification.
Further investigation will examine the practicality of using MEADcast on the
    internet, taking into consideration concerns related to IPv6 extension
    header processing \cite{rfc7872_ext_hdrs_drop_rate}.
% paragraph Feasibility Study (end)

\paragraph{Performance Evaluation} % (fold)
\label{par:Performance Evaluation}
A comparative performance analysis will be conducted to evaluate MEADcast in
    comparison to both IP unicast and multicast.
This assessment will provide insights into the efficiency and effectiveness of
    MEADcast as a multipoint communication solution.
% paragraph Performance Evaluation (end)

\paragraph{Scenario identification} % (fold)
\label{par:Scenario identification}
Building on the results of the previous evaluation steps, this phase involves
    identifying scenarios, application categories, and characteristics that
    justify the utilization of MEADcast.
Thereby, it can be determined where MEADcast may offer advantages and excel in
    real-world applications.
    
% paragraph Scenario identification (end)
    
\paragraph{} % (fold)
% \hfill\newline
The findings indicate, that with certain limitations, MEADcast is applicable in
    real networks.
The current protocol specification suffers from poor availability on the
    internet due to the limited processing of IPv6 packets with extension
    headers.
However, the proposed modification effectively addresses this obstacle while
    enhancing receiver privacy.
Our measurements suggest that MEADcast's performance falls between uni- and
    multicast, particularly showing promise in scenarios characterized by
    limited bandwidth and network control.
