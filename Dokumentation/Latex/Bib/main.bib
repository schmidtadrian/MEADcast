Multicast DNS (mDNS) provides the ability to perform DNS-like operations on the local link in the absence of any conventional Unicast DNS server. In addition, Multicast DNS designates a portion of the DNS namespace to be free for local use, without the need to pay any annual fee, and without the need to set up delegations or otherwise configure a conventional DNS server to answer for those names. The primary benefits of Multicast DNS names are that (i) they require little or no administration or configuration to set them up, (ii) they work when no infrastructure is present, and (iii) they work during infrastructure failures.},

abstract="When readers study on campus, work in a company, or shop at the mall, they may notice that these places are all covered by networks. Through these networks, one can access internal school resources, use internal devices of the company such as printers, or access the Internet to browse news and information. These networks are classified as campus networks and are usually built by the companies or organizations themselves. Campus networks not only enhance the operational efficiency of enterprises, but also provide network access services to the outside world.",
